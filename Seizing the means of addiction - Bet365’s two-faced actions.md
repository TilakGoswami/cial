Bet365, one of the largest UK bookmakers (betting companies), recently published their [financial reports](https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/04241161/filing-history/MzQ5NTE0MTEzM2FkaXF6a2N4/document?format=pdf&download=0) on the 22nd of December 2025. In the financial year 2024/25, they recorded revenues from betting of £4.03bn, up from £3.7bn in 2023/24, an increase of roughly 9%. Admirable.

However, their profits fell from £626mn in 2023/24 to £348mn in 2024/25, a decrease of more than 40%. Less admirable.

From this, one might say bet365 did not have a good year. I would have to agree. However, the CEO, one Denise Coates, would not. According to the [FT](https://www.ft.com/content/7b682a66-df96-4448-8953-9b954eda0f48#comments-anchor), her salary in the financial year 2024/25 was £104mn. Due to her majority stake in the company, she also received at least half of the £313.6mn in dividends paid to the family. In total, her total payout “rose by 65 per cent from £150mn in 2024 to at least £260.8mn”. This is problematic in two ways.

Firstly, the obvious. Coates’ firm loses money, yet she earns considerably more money. In which interpretation of a capitalist economy does this make sense? In which interpretation of capitalism does it make sense that bet365 makes significantly less profit, and Coates still earns more money? Clearly, her income is not an accurate reflection of the value she brings to her company, a misappropriation of funds in a failing modern-day capitalistic society, where executives are free to run unchecked, shamelessly privately profiting off of the losses of a predominantly [young](https://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/statistics-and-research/publication/statistics-on-gambling-participation-wave-2-april-to-july-2025-official) demographic.

The second reason is the mere fact that she, and her company, are profiting at all. Bet365 making a profit at all means they are receiving more money from their “customers” than they are paying out. Coates and bet365 are profiting off the misfortune of their “customers”, addicted gamblers who across all bookies in March 2025 alone made more than [1 billion bets/spins on machines](https://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/statistics-and-research/publication/gambling-business-data-on-gambling-to-march-2025-published-may-2025#ref-3).

Now, a review of some comments on the FT article, I found particularly disgusting.

“Well done to Denise. Girl power!”

“I applaud her as a successful entrepreneur who pays lots of tax to HMRC plus more to charity.”

The second piqued my interest. “More to charity” you say? Let’s explore that claim then.

Bet365’s financial documents state £130mn were donated to a charity by the name of the Denise Coates Foundation. Does that name ring a bell? Spot on! That’s the name of bet365’s very own executive. But that’s not necessarily a bad thing. Perhaps they just donate it to the foundation so it’s easier to donate all £130mn to various charities. Or is it…

Refer to the image below, a summary of the DCF’s incomes and expenses, which can be found on page 15 of the document.

![[Pasted image 20251231004709.png]]

Note: all numbers are in 1000s, so for example “130,000” is 130,000,000.

This statement is a portrait, if instead of the portrait being beautiful, it were damning.

Firstly, the incomes. £130mn incomes from bet365’s “charitable” donation. On top of this, comes £12.8mn and £1.1mn from investment income, leading to total income of £143,968,000. Then, there are expenses. £2,171,000 in investment expenses, and just £16,819,000 in charitable activities. Only £16.8mn in donations to charities, when the DCF netted more than £100mn in income? Surely not. Surely the wealthy wouldn’t be two-faced and appear as if they are supporting vulnerable and needy people by donating £130mn, and then actually donate only 13% of that. Surely the wealthy would give back, benefit the society that they stole so inconspicuously from to line their own coin purses. But, it gets worse. Surely they donated more in the past, and they only donated so little this year, an outlier in the trend. As you may have predicted, this is not an anomalous result, rather a conscious and well-thought out decision made by bet365’s directors to portray them to the public in a positive, generous and caring light, whilst in the background they cruelly and coldly evade hundreds of millions in tax, as company donations to “charities” are exempt from corporation tax.

The DCF’s coin purses weighed a staggering £942mn in the financial year 2023/24. Christmas must have come many months early for the DCF, because they ended the financial year 2024/25 with a booty amounting to more than £1 billion, the majority of which came from donations, £120mn in 2023/24, £100mn in 22/23, need I go on…

Coming back to the comment. “More to charity”, they said. This “charity” has more than £1 billion to their name, and yet gives to charity £11mn in 22/23, £11.3mn in 23/24 and £16.8mn in 24/25, not even 2%?

Speaking of; commenters are quick to speak highly of Coates for keeping her business in England, and paying her “fair share” of tax. How much tax does she and her company really pay, and not pay?

The same FT article reports £481.5mn contributed to the Treasury, a sizable amount: “The family is one of Britain’s highest taxpayers “. Good for them. They are indeed making sure us lowly peasants can access healthcare, get a basic education and have access to functioning public infrastructure.

As an aside, I find it humorous that so much emphasis is placed on her paying her taxes in the UK, yet when us ordinary citizens pay our tax, not an eye is batted. Just shows how common tax evasion is, when large gaming brands such as Ladbrokes, Coral, William Hill are all based in Gibraltar and pay a lower corporation tax rate.

Think back to that juicy £1 billion that was snatched from the taxman’s hands. If corporation tax were to be paid on that £1 billion, the Treasury would be £250mn richer. Not much in the grand scheme of things, but that is £250mn bet365 has quietly stolen from suicidal teens desperately waiting for access to counselling services, fixed income pensioners struggling to keep warm during winter and single parents working 3 jobs to pay for the ever increasing cost of living.

Can that £481.5mn cover the cost of hapless gamblers losing [“the ability to meet basic needs, such as buying food, essential medications, clothing, housing, children’s educational requirements and transport costs”](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/63bc25b4d3bf7f262c5ad31f/The-economic-cost-of-gambling-related-harm-in-England_evidence-update-2023.pdf)? Can it cover the cost of a 97.5% chance of missing a mortgage payment, or the 40% likelihood of people that seeked support who had debts exceeding £5,000, or the 11.6% of homeless people identified as “problem gamblers”?

At the end of the day, this is a moral question. Should one benefit from the misfortune of others? Coates would argue many people win lots of money, and as a result, she should be reimbursed for providing a sought after service, but would be one of the last to admit the vast majority lose money before they see the faintest of green in their coffers. Personally, I think this act is disgusting. That £481mn is filthy, obscene, soiled money, taken mercilessly from the most vulnerable of society, a lame justification for an inherently inequal
